        "## Understanding stationarity in TS\n\nIn time series analysis, \"stationarity\" refers to a key assumption about the behavior\nof a time series over time. A stationary time series is one in which statistical properties,\nsuch as mean, variance, and autocorrelation, remain constant over time. Stationarity is an\nimportant concept because many time series analysis techniques rely on this assumption for\ntheir validity. There are different types of stationarity that can be observed in time series\ndata. Let's explore them:\n\n- **Strict Stationarity:** A time series is considered strictly stationary if the joint probability\n  distribution of any set of its time points is invariant over time. This means that the statistical\n  properties, such as mean, variance, and covariance, are constant across all time points.\n\n- **Weak Stationarity:** Weak stationarity, also known as second-order stationarity or covariance\n  stationarity, is a less strict form of stationarity. A time series is considered weakly stationary\n  if its mean and variance are constant over time, and the autocovariance between any two time points\n  only depends on the time lag between them. In other words, the statistical properties of the time\n  series do not change with time.\n\n- **Trend Stationarity:** Trend stationarity refers to a time series that exhibits a stable mean over\n  time but may have a changing variance. This means that the data has a consistent trend component but\n  the other statistical properties remain constant. In trend stationary series, the mean of the time\n  series can be modeled by a constant or a linear trend.\n\n- **Difference Stationarity:** Difference stationarity, also known as integrated stationarity, occurs\n  when differencing a non-stationary time series results in a stationary series. Differencing involves\n  computing the differences between consecutive observations to remove trends or other non-stationary\n  patterns. A differenced time series is said to be difference stationary if it exhibits weak stationarity\n  after differencing.\n\n- **Seasonal Stationarity:** ...\n\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Unit_root_hypothesis_diagram.svg/1280px-Unit_root_hypothesis_diagram.svg.png\" width=\"200\" align=\"right\" alt=\"skewness\">\n\nThe augmented Dickey\u2013Fuller test or ``ADF`` can be used to determine the presence of a unit root.\nWhen the other roots of the characteristic function lie inside the unit circle the first\ndifference of the process is stationary. Due to this property, these are also called\ndifference-stationary processes. Since the absence of unit root is not a proof of non-stationarity,\nthe Kwiatkowski\u2013Phillips\u2013Schmidt\u2013Shin or ``KPSS`` test can be used to identify the existence of an\nunderlying trend which can also be removed to obtain a stationary process. These are called\ntrend-stationary processes. In both, unit-root and trend-stationary processes, the mean can be\nincreasing or decreasing over time; however, in the presence of a shock, trend-stationary\nprocesses (blue) revert to this mean tendency in the long run (deterministic trend) while unit-root\nprocesses (green) have a permanent impact (stochastic trend). The significance level of the tests\nis usually set to 0.05.\n\n\n================== ================== ========================= ============================\nADF                KPSS               Outcome                   Note\n================== ================== ========================= ============================\n``Non-Stationary`` ``Non-Stationary`` ``Non-Stationary``\n``Stationary``     ``Stationary``     ``Stationary``\n``Non-Stationary`` ``Stationary``     ``Trend-Stationary``      Check the de-trended series\n``Stationary``     ``Non-Stationary`` ``Difference-Stationary`` Check the differenced-series\n================== ================== ========================= ============================\n\n\nSee also `sphx_glr__examples_tutorial_statistics_plot_core_stats_stationarity.py`\n\n\n"
