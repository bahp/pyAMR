Step 03 - TSA for trends
========================

.. warning:: To be completed!

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 10-72

The diagram in Figure 4.7 describes the methodology implemented to estimate secular
trends in AMR from susceptibility data. Since data corruption might occur in clinical
environments, those susceptibility test records wrongly reported (human or device errors)
or duplicated were discarded. The remaining records were divided into combinations
(tuples defined by sample type, pathogen and antimicrobial) for which a resistance time
series signal was generated using either independent or overlapping time intervals (see
xxx). The time series were linearly interpolated to fill sporadic missing values. No
additional filters or preprocessing steps were applied. An analysis of stationarity around
a trend was carried out to identify interesting combinations and regression
analysis was used to quantify its tendency

The linear model (see Equation 4.3) has been selected to quantify resistance tendency
for several reasons: (i) the development of resistance in pathogens is an evolutionary
response to the selective pressure of antimicrobials, hence large variations in short
periods (e.g. consecutive days or months) are not expected (ii) the slope parameter can
be directly translated to change over time increasing its practicability and (iii) the
offset parameter is highly related with the overall resistance. Hence, the response variable
in regression analysis (resistance index) is described by the explanatory variable (time).
The slope (m) ranges within the interval [-1,1] where sign and absolute value capture
direction and rate of change respectively. The unit of the slope is represented by ∆y/∆x.

- **Least Squares Regression**

  The optimization problem in ordinary least squares - ``OLS`` - regression minimizes the least
  square errors to find the best fitting model. Ordinary least squares - OLS - assumes
  identical weights (wi) and independently distributed residuals with a normal distribution.
  It is frequent to observe that some residuals might have higher variance than others,
  meaning that those observations are effectively less certain. To contemplate such variability,
  weighted linear squares - ``WLS`` - regression (see Equation 4.4) applies a weighting
  function to the residuals. The confidence of the computed resistance index (observed
  variable) relies on the number of susceptibility test records manipulated. Hence, the
  sigmoid function has been used to define weights proportional to the population size.

- **Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average** - ``ARIMA``

  An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is a generalization of an
  autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model which can be also applied in scenarios
  where data show evidence of non-stationarity. The autoregressive (AR) part expresses
  the variable of interest (resistance index) as a function of past values of the variable.
  The moving average (MA) indicates that the regression error is a linear combination of
  error terms which occurred contemporaneously and at various times in the past. An
  ARIMA(p,d,q) model is described by: p is the number of autoregressive terms,
  d is the number of differences needed for stationarity and q is the
  number of lagged forecast errors.

  Include formula.

  The interpretation of the parameter µ depends on the ARIMA model used for the
  fitting. In order to estimate the linear trend, it was interesting to consider exclusively
  MA models so that the expected value of µ was the mean of the one-time differenced
  series; that is, the slope coefficient of the un-differenced series. The Bayesian information
  criterion (BIC) was used to select the best ARIMA(0,1,q) model, being the one with the
  lowest BIC the preferred.
