Taxonomy
--------

Bacterial taxonomy is the taxonomy, i.e. the rank-based classification, of bacteria.

In the scientific classification established by Carl Linnaeus,[1] each species has to be assigned
to a genus (binary nomenclature), which in turn is a lower level of a hierarchy of ranks (family,
suborder, order, subclass, class, division/phyla, kingdom and domain). In the currently accepted
classification of life, there are three domains (Eukaryotes, Bacteria and Archaea),[2] which, in
terms of taxonomy, despite following the same principles have several different conventions between
them and between their subdivisions.

  - life
  - domain
  - kingdom
  - phylum
  - class
  - order
  - family
  - genus
  - species
  - subspecies (missing in dataset)

Gram Stain
----------

Gram stain or Gram staining, also called Gram's method, is a method of staining used to distinguish
and classify bacterial species into two large groups: gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria.
The name comes from the Danish bacteriologist Hans Christian Gram, who developed the technique. Gram
staining differentiates bacteria by the chemical and physical properties of their cell walls.

  - positive:
        Gram-positive cells have a thick layer of peptidoglycan in the cell wall that retains
        the primary stain, crystal violet.

  - negative
        Gram-negative cells have a thinner peptidoglycan layer that allows the crystal violet to
        wash out on addition of ethanol.
