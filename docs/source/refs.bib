	abstract = {Objectives Antimicrobial resistance has become a global burden for which inappropriate antimicrobial use is an important contributing factor. Any decisions on the selection of antibiotics use should consider their effects on antimicrobial resistance. The objective of this study was to assess the extent to which antibiotic prescribing guidelines have considered resistance patterns when making recommendations for five highly prevalent infectious syndromes.Design We used Medline searches complemented with extensive use of Web engine to identify guidelines on empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, urinary tract infections, acute otitis media, rhinosinusitis and pharyngitis. We collected data on microbiology and resistance patterns and identified discrete pattern categories. We assessed the extent to which recommendations considered resistance, in addition to efficacy and safety, when recommending antibiotics.Results We identified 135 guidelines, which reported a total of 251 recommendations. Most (103/135, 79\%) were from developed countries. Community-acquired pneumonia was the syndrome mostly represented (51, 39\%). In only 16 (6.4\%) recommendations, selection of empirical antibiotic was discussed in relation to resistance and specific microbiological data. In a further 69 (27.5\%) recommendations, references were made in relation to resistance, but the attempt was inconsistent. Across syndromes, 12 patterns of resistance with implications on recommendations were observed. 50\% to 75\% of recommendations did not attempt to set recommendation in the context of these patterns.Conclusion There is consistent evidence that guidelines on empirical antibiotic use did not routinely consider resistance in their recommendations. Decision-makers should analyse and report the extent of local resistance patterns to allow better decision-making.},

    abstract = "{Infection diagnosis can be challenging, relying on clinical judgement and non-specific markers of infection. We evaluated a supervised machine learning (SML) algorithm for diagnosing bacterial infection using routinely available blood parameters on presentation to hospital.An SML algorithm was developed to classify cases into infection versus no infection using microbiology records and six available blood parameters (C-reactive protein, white cell count, bilirubin, creatinine, ALT and alkaline phosphatase) from 160203 individuals. A cohort of patients admitted to hospital over a 6 month period had their admission blood parameters prospectively inputted into the SML algorithm. They were prospectively followed up from admission to classify those who fulfilled clinical case criteria for a community-acquired bacterial infection within 72 h of admission using a pre-determined definition. Predictive ability was assessed using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) with cut-off values for optimal sensitivity and specificity explored.One hundred and four individuals were included prospectively. The median (range) cohort age was 65 (21–98)  years. The majority were female (56/104; 54\%). Thirty-six (35\%) were diagnosed with infection in the first 72 h of admission. Overall, 44/104 (42\%) individuals had microbiological investigations performed. Treatment was prescribed for 33/36 (92\%) of infected individuals and 4/68 (6\%) of those with no identifiable bacterial infection. Mean (SD) likelihood estimates for those with and without infection were significantly different. The infection group had a likelihood of 0.80 (0.09) and the non-infection group 0.50 (0.29) (P \&lt; 0.01; 95\% CI: 0.20–0.40). ROC AUC was 0.84 (95\% CI: 0.76–0.91).An SML algorithm was able to diagnose infection in individuals presenting to hospital using routinely available blood parameters.}",
