Examples with Indexes
=====================

.. todo:: Create ``sub-galleries`` for each of the indexes when the
          number of samples grow.

The examples presented in the gallery below show how to use some of the
tools provided in this module to compute various indexes. The indexes
that are supported are:

  - ``SARI``: Single Antimicrobial Resistance Index
  - ``MARI``: Multiple Antimicrobial Resistance Index (pending)
  - ``SART``: Single Antimicrobial Resistance Trend
  - ``ASAI``: Antibimicrobial Spectrum of Activity Index
