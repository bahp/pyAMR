# Registries
# ----------
#
# .. todo:: Not implemented. Explain how to generate and edit registry.
#
# The registries aim to facilitate to find the relevant information for
# microorganisms and antimicrobials.
#
#
# For the antimicrobials...
#
# .. literalinclude :: ./../README.rst

# For the microorganisms...

# gram_positive.txt
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Gram-positive_bacteria
# gram_negative.txt
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Gram-negative_bacteria
#
# In order to create the database with gram stains, we have downloaded the
# list from the wikipedia, thus, we have two files ``gram_negative.txt`` and
# ``gram_positive.txt``. We have combined them into a single .csv file named
# ``db_gram_stain.csv``.
#
# bac120_taxonomy.tsv
#
# In order to create the database with the taxonomy, we have downloaded the
# information and saved in the file ``bac120_taxonomy.tsv``. Then we have done
# some minor amendments and the result has been saved into a single .csv
# names ``db_taxonomy.csv``.
