PyAMR is a python lightweight library to facilitate the computation of common Antimicrobial 
Resistance (AMR) related statistics such as the proportion of resistance isolates, the 
resistance trend or the antimicrobial spectrum of activity. In addition, it includes a number 
of examples to visualise such information which relay on plotting libraries such as 
``matplotlib``, ``seaborn`` or ``plotly``.
