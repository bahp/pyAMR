Outputs:
registry_microorganisms.csv
    This database contains all the classification columns for the
    microorganisms. It is automatically constructed from the sub
    databases (e.g. db_gram_stain or db_taxonomy).

registry_additions.csv
    This database has the same structure as the db_classification.csv
    but contains examples that have been recorded manually by us. It
    could be new species not found in the database or corrections that
    we wanna overwrite.
